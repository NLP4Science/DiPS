* Overview of DiPS during decoding to generate k paraphrases. At each time step, a set of N sequences V<sup>t</sup> is used to determine k &lt; N sequences (X<sup>âˆ—</sup>) via submodular maximization . The above figure illustrates the motivation behind each submodular component. Please see Section 4 in the paper for details.
